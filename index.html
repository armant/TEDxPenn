Which ideas have led to discovery? What is the spark that is igniting the possibilities for a good future? How can we create a ripple effect that will leave the world as a better place?

                                    <em>Fascinated by the complex structures of living human organs, Bioengineer professor and innovator Dan Huh hopes to help researchers better understand the human body and the progression of different diseases through the use of an organ-on-a-chip technology model.</em><br><br>
                                    <div class="hide-me">
                                    <strong class="ted-font">Why you should listen</strong><br><br>

As a postdoctoral research fellow at Harvard University’s Wyss Institute, Huh worked with Donald Ingber to develop the first organs-on-chips using microengineering technologies for cell biology. These microchips served as accurate models of human organs.  <br><br>

Realizing how the current models used to study disease failed to accurately simulate key biological processes that mediate disease progression and exacerbation, Huh uses  the organ-on-a-chip technology to engineer predictable and cost-effective pre-clinical testing devices. <br><br>

Huh is now a Wilf Family Term Endowed Chair and an Assistant Professor in the Department of Bioengineering at the University of Pennsylvania. Huh has authored over 30 papers in Science, Nature, Nature Materials, PNAS, and other major research journals. He has won several honors and awards including the NIH Director’s New Innovator Award, which grants innovators $1.5 million during the next five years to work on groundbreaking technologies.<br><br>

<em>“Nature is often said to be the greatest innovator. University of Pennsylvania engineer Dan Huh, a pioneer in the development of “organs-on-chips,” tiny, three-dimensional models of living human organs, uses nature’s creativity as a source of inspiration.”<br> - Madeleine Stone, Penn News 10/5/2014</em><br><br><br>

                                    <em>Judy Gelles travelled to different communities around the world and photographed fourth graders, asking them what they wished for and what they worried about.

Over the past six years, Judy Gelles interviewed and photographed over 200 fourth grade students from a wide range of economic and cultural backgrounds in China, India, South Korea, England, Saint Lucia, and multiple areas of the United States. She asked all of the students the same three questions: Who do you live with? What do you wish for? What do you worry about?<br><br>
 
A notable commonality across all schools was that every group of fourth-graders had very little contact with or knowledge of people from cultural or socioeconomic backgrounds that were different from their own. The Fourth Grade Project has connected children locally and globally, building bridges and tearing down walls.<br><br>

Gelles’s work can be found in major collections including the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, and the Museum of Modern Art in Rio de Janeiro. In 2013, Critical Mass listed her as one of the top 50 photographers in the US.<br><br>

<em>“Upon meeting Judy, I was met with a warm, caring smile and a genuine enthusiasm for her work. After chatting a little about the project, it was clear from the start that she possessed a real passion for art and an even bigger love of the children she was working with. Her ability to interact and work with my fourth grade class was remarkable and the students had nothing but glowing reviews of Judy.” <br> - Fourth Grade Teacher, USA Jewish Day School.</em><br><br><br>

Peter Struck draws from antiquity to explore intuition, a common thread that has linked humanity throughout the ages. He specializes in Roman and Greek literature and explores the history of ideas and the construction of meaning. The insights he draws from these ancient works demonstrate how our perception of the world today may not be so different from those during the height of antiquity.<br><br>
 
Struck is an accomplished lecturer at the University of Pennsylvania, having received the university’s highest award for teaching, the Lindback Award. At the university, he is the director of the Benjamin Franklin Scholars Program and a professor in the Classical Studies Undergraduate Department. Currently, he is writing about the applications of Greek and Roman divination in <em>Divine Signs and Human Nature: A Cognitive History of Divination in Antiquity</em>.<br><br>

                                    <em>Twelve years ago, Jonathan Iwry set out to uncover the art of freestyle rapping. He discovered that improvisation is less a talent than a skill—and even a philosophy.</em><br><br>

Jonathan Iwry aims to demystify improvisation. Performing off the cuff is frequently regarded as an elusive gift—opaque and intimidating. Iwry believes that improvisation is not just a skill capable of being learned, but also an aspect of everyday life. Learning to think on our feet can strengthen our creativity, our connection with the world, and ultimately our preparation for what lies ahead.<br><br>
 
A recent Penn graduate, Iwry double-majored in Philosophy and Intellectual History. He is a four-time winner of Penn’s Got Talent and three-time performer at the annual Spring Fling. He was invited to join the music department’s panel discussion for Penn’s Year of Sound, where he performed for the incoming freshman class. In addition, Iwry founded the Penn Hip-Hop Initiative and was a weekly opinion columnist for The Daily Pennsylvanian.</em>.<br><br>

While seemingly beneficial, the discovery of incidentalomas, principally through radiology, has created major, disquieting issues. The mounting number of incidentalomas means that patients are increasingly confronted with difficult decisions whether to undergo additional tests, biopsies and surgeries or do nothing. Wruble studies the benefits of technological advances and the unnerving side effects that occur in advising patients. She aims to find a prudent perspective that promotes physical and mental well-being but is also economically sustainable.<br><br>
 
Wruble is a radiologist at the West Haven Connecticut Veterans Administration Medical Center. She teaches residents at Yale School of Medicine and University of Connecticut Medical Center. With her expertise in incidentalomas, she chaired a blue-ribbon panel discussion on this issue at the 2014 National Association of Veterans Affairs Physicians and Dentists Summit.</em><br><br>

Lyle Ungar analyzed 148 million tweets from more than 1,300 counties that represent 88 percent of the U.S. population. He uncovered that language and mortality have a strong relationship, even after variables like education and income were accounted for. Positive emotional language like “wonderful” in a community seems to offer protection against heart disease, while swearing correlates with increased mortality. Ungar aims to use this understanding to foster optimism in communities and make people happier and healthier.<br><br>

Candy saves lives. Spencer Penn and Penn students Thoba Grenville-Grey, Eric Kauderer-Abrams, Morgan Snyder, and Joshua Tycko co-founded Sweet Bites - a social venture that manufactures cavity fighting chewing gum. The single-serving packaging, printed with health messages, is distributed through traditional corner stores and school-lunch programs. With the help of local female dental students, NGO's, Penn Dental, and the Clinton Global Initiative, Sweet Bites has piloted projects with their Xylitol gum in 5 continents.<br><br>
 
Sweet Bites was selected as a global finalist for the prestigious Hult Prize and its co-founders were invited to speak at the the annual Clinton Global Initiative conference in New York. In 2014, Spencer Penn graduated from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania and is currently a Robotics Engineering Masters student at the university. Spencer served as the 2014 Class President at Penn for four years in undergrad.</em><br><br>

David Gruber uncovered the secret language of biofluorescence in marine animals, such as swell sharks and false moray eels. He studies fluorescent proteins and how marine creatures use colors to communicate, interact, and avoid enemies. With insights into the fluorescent world that humans cannot detect, Gruber and his collaborators have found a novel way for us to perceive and better understand life in the sea.<br><br>
 
Committed to ocean conservation and the public understanding of science, Gruber is an Emerging Explorer at National Geographic. His research has been featured in exhibits at American Museum of Natural History. Besides regularly diving into the ocean, he is an Associate Professor of Biology at the City University of New York and a Research Associate at the American Museum of Natural History.</em><br><br>

<em>“Gruber conveys the spirit of scientific endeavor perfectly: discovery is not just a goal, but an unpredictable process as dependent on intellectual genius as on creative inspiration and pure luck … biofluorescence is revolutionary: use of fluorescent protein technology is now the order of the day” <br> - Jennifer Lippincott-Schwartz, National Institute of Health</em><br><br><br>
