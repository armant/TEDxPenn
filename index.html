As a postdoctoral research fellow at Harvard University’s Wyss Institute, Huh worked with Donald Ingber to develop the first organs-on-chips using microengineering technologies for cell biology. These microchips served as accurate models of human organs.  <br><br>

Realizing how the current models used to study disease failed to accurately simulate key biological processes that mediate disease progression and exacerbation, Huh uses  the organ-on-a-chip technology to engineer predictable and cost-effective pre-clinical testing devices. <br><br>

Huh is now a Wilf Family Term Endowed Chair and an Assistant Professor in the Department of Bioengineering at the University of Pennsylvania. Huh has authored over 30 papers in Science, Nature, Nature Materials, PNAS, and other major research journals. He has won several honors and awards including the NIH Director’s New Innovator Award, which grants innovators $1.5 million during the next five years to work on groundbreaking technologies.<br><br>

                                    <em>Judy Gelles travelled to different communities around the world and photographed fourth graders, asking them what they wished for and what they worried about.

Over the past six years, Judy Gelles interviewed and photographed over 200 fourth grade students from a wide range of economic and cultural backgrounds in China, India, South Korea, England, Saint Lucia, and multiple areas of the United States. She asked all of the students the same three questions: Who do you live with? What do you wish for? What do you worry about?<br><br>
 
A notable commonality across all schools was that every group of fourth-graders had very little contact with or knowledge of people from cultural or socioeconomic backgrounds that were different from their own. The Fourth Grade Project has connected children locally and globally, building bridges and tearing down walls.<br><br>

Gelles’s work can be found in major collections including the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, and the Museum of Modern Art in Rio de Janeiro. In 2013, Critical Mass listed her as one of the top 50 photographers in the US.<br><br>

<em>“Upon meeting Judy, I was met with a warm, caring smile and a genuine enthusiasm for her work. After chatting a little about the project, it was clear from the start that she possessed a real passion for art and an even bigger love of the children she was working with. Her ability to interact and work with my fourth grade class was remarkable and the students had nothing but glowing reviews of Judy.” <br> - Fourth Grade Teacher, USA Jewish Day School.</em><br><br><br>

Eric Corey Freed is calling for the adoption of a new mentality when it comes to architecture. Freed believes that today’s "harsh, style-driven fashions” in architecture can be improve through building responsibly, reducing waste, and preserving the environment. The author of <em>Green Building & Remodeling for Dummies</em>, Freed has sold over 200,000 copies of his book and has helped thousands of companies and dozens of municipalities around the country monetize sustainability. <br><br>
Today, Freed continues the tradition of “Organic Architecture”, first developed by Frank Lloyd Wright, and works to bridge the gap between human habitation and the natural world. A renowned leader in the sustainable architecture field, Freed was named by San Francisco Magazine as "Best Green Architect" in 2005 and "Best Visionary" in 2007. He was also named one of the "Top 10 Most Influential Green Architects."<br><br>

<em>“After hearing Freed’s talk, I couldn't really explain it, but I just felt better. I felt more upbeat about the future after being able to laugh about it. Perhaps in addition to trying to live green, I will try to remember to laugh my way to a green future.” <br> - Bonnie Hulkower, TreeHugger Writer and Environmental Planner</em><br><br><br>
